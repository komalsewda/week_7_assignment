This is the Weekâ€¯7 assignment for the Celebal Technologies Data Science program.

It predicts the **sentiment score** of a social media post based on metadata such as platform, post type, likes, comments, 
and shares using a **Random Forest Classifier**. The application is built using **Streamlit** and visualized with **Plotly**.



**Overview**
